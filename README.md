# Skin-Cancer-Classification-Using-CNN
Introduction

Skin cancer is one of the most common forms of cancer worldwide. Early detection plays a crucial role in increasing survival rates and improving treatment effectiveness. This project leverages Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to develop a deep learning-based system that classifies skin conditions and assists in early diagnosis.
